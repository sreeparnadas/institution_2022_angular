        <p>If you want to find out the future value of a particular investment which has a constant interest rate and periodic payment, use the following formula –</p>

          <li>[Pmt] = Payment/period</li>
          <li>PV = Present Value</li>

      <p-accordionTab header="PMT">
        <p>The Excel PMT function is a financial function that calculates the payment for a loan based on a constant interest rate, the number of periods and the loan amount.

          "PMT" stands for "payment", hence the function's name.</p>
          <h3>PMT(rate, nper, pv, [fv], [type])</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Rate (required) - the constant interest rate per period. Can be supplied as percentage or decimal number</li>
            <li>Nper (required) - the number of payments for the loan, i.e. the total number of periods over which the loan should be paid.</li>
            <li>Pv (required) - the present value, i.e. the total amount that all future payments are worth now. In case of a loan, it's simply the original amount borrowed.</li>
            <li>Fv (optional) - the future value, or the cash balance you wish to have after the last payment is made. If omitted, the future value of the loan is assumed to be zero (0).</li>
            <ul>
              Type (optional) - specifies when the payments are due:
              <li>0 or omitted - payments are due at the end of each period.</li>
              <li>1 - payments are due at the beginning of each period.</li>
